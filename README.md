# Travel-journey
I created a "Travel Journey" project that showcases adventurous and beautiful places to explore. The project includes Home, Login, About, Stories, Gallery, and Contact pages. I built this project using HTML and CSS

Travel Journey Website (HTML + CSS)

Built a travel-themed website showcasing adventurous and beautiful destinations.

Integrated a Login/Registration system to access the content pages.

About Page: Highlights the destinations explored with descriptive content.

Stories Page: Detailed travel experiences focusing on exciting places.

Gallery Page: Photo collection from the journeys.

Contact Page: Includes phone, email, and location details, with an invitation for users to connect.

Focused on UI design, structured navigation, and content presentation using only HTML and CSS.
